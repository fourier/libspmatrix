TODO
====

Current tasks for the libspmatrix.

* Direct methods:

** Cholesky decomposition
*** Implement left-looking numeric Cholesky decomposition instead of
    up-looking
*** Compare the performance of the left-looking and up-looking numeric
    Cholesky decomposition in the solvertest application
*** Add calculation of the row/column counts using Skeleton matrix instead
    of row subtrees, taking O(|A|) instead of O(|L|) operations
*** Add support of the row/column reordering to the Cholesky method
*** Implement 1-2 reordering techniques (nested dissection? Cuthil-McKee?
    etc.)

* Numeric methods
** Implement sparse LU decomposition or Gauss method
** Implement BICGSTAB method

* General issues
** Add automatic smart bandwidth selection based on FEA-matricies
   statistics in addition to the manual selection
** Update documentation coverage
** Verify the consistency of init/free functions declarations and usage
** Add indexed_array init/free/copy methods to sp_cont and refactor sp_matrix using them
** Create native Win32 version
